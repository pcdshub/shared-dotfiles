Key bindings
============

``fzf`` support is enabled by default. Use the following key combinations to use the fuzzy-finding
features:

* ``Ctrl-r`` - press this to fuzzily search through your bash history.
    * Type to filter items in your history.
    * Find the item you're looking for? Press enter to put it in your command-line.
    * To cancel, hit ``Ctrl-c``.
* ``Ctrl-t`` - press this to fuzzily search through files in your current directory.
    * Type to filter the items in your directory.
    * Find the file/directory you're looking for? Press enter to insert it in the command line.
    * To cancel, hit ``Ctrl-c``.

The rest are common readline key mappings that I find useful:

* ``Ctrl-a`` - press this to go to the beginning of your input while typing in bash.
* ``Ctrl-e`` - press this to go to the end of your input while typing in bash.
* ``Ctrl-l`` - press this to clear your screen quickly.
* ``Ctrl-c`` - press this to stop your current process.
* ``Ctrl-z`` - press this to pause your current process.
    * Use ``bg`` to let it run in the background.
    * Use ``fg`` to bring it back to the foreground.
    * Type ``jobs`` to see what's been backgrounded or paused.
* ``Ctrl-u`` to cut everything up to your cursor.
    * ``Ctrl-y`` to paste it back.
* ``Ctrl-w`` to cut the previous word(s).
    * ``Ctrl-y`` to paste it/them back.


tmux
----

* ``Ctrl-q`` is used as the default prefix.
* See [tmux.conf](tmux.conf) for further bindings for working with panels.


vim
---

* Ex mode is disabled by default, rebinding ``Q`` to ``gq`` (reformat).
* Otherwise, no specific bindings are added to the default vim configuration.

/reg/common/tools/bin
---------------------

/reg/common/tools/bin contains scripts such as:
* Tools for inspecting or interacting with released EPICS modules:
   - ``epics-checkout``
   - ``epics-release``
   - ``epics-versions`` (and other eco_tools)

   - ``psipmi``


Other commands
--------------

There are a lot of commands available in your environment.

To see a list of all of them and where they come from, type:

```bash
$ which_command
```

Consider piping that into fzf to find the command you are looking for:

```bash
$ which_command | fzf
```

Navigation
==========

Navigating up directories
-------------------------

```bash
$ cd ..

# Or try our handy aliases. This is the same as cd ../../..
$ ..3
```

Navigating over SSH
-------------------

```
sshcd - ssh to a host, retaining your current directory
  Usage:   sshcd hostname [optional command to run]
  Example: sshcd lfe-console ls -l
```

Navigating to the newest subdirectory
-------------------------------------

```bash
$ cdnewest
```

Navigating to IOC directories
-----------------------------

Navigating to an IOC's directory via "ioctool":

```bash
$ source ioctool PV:NAME cddir
$ source ioctool ioc-name cddir
```

Navigating to an IOC's directory via "cdioc":

```bash
$ cdioc
# (type to filter the list and select an item)
```

or, if you know the name already:

```bash
$ cdioc iocname
```

To get to an IOC data directory quickly:

```bash
$ cdiocdata
```

To list all IOCs:

```bash
$ list_all_iocs
```

To get basic or more detailed JSON information about a certain IOC:

```bash
$ which_ioc
$ which_ioc_json
```

Navigating to hutch-python directories
--------------------------------------

* ``cdhutchconfig`` hutch configuration directory
* ``cdhutchp`` hutch-python configuration directory
* ``cdhutchp_logs`` hutch-python log directory


Viewing logs
------------

```bash
$ ioclog iocname
```

Netconfig
=========

Searching for netconfig information about a host, IP address, etc.:

```bash
$ netconfig search text
```

Adding a new host:

```bash
$ netconfig add
```

Other information is available with ``netconfig --help``.

Built-in fuzzy-finding helpers are also available.  To pick just a hostname
for usage with another command, try:

```bash
$ pick_host
```

Or to get host information in JSON:

```bash
$ which_host_json
```

``jq`` can be used to get IP address information and more:

```bash
$ which_host_json | jq ".ipHostNumber"
[
  "172.21.48.34"
]
```


Shared filesystems
==================

| Directory        | Description                                                    |

| /reg/g/          | Older, deprecated path for /cds/group                          |

Python environments
-------------------

To access our deployed conda environments, see:
https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/PCDS+Conda+Python+Environments

Generally, you should only need to run the following on a machine like
psbuild-rhel7:

```bash
$ source /cds/group/pcds/pyps/conda/pcds_conda
```

And note that the source of these configurations is:
<https://github.com/pcdshub/pcds-envs>

Happi configuration
-------------------

HAPPI_CFG is set automatically in our Python environment scripts. We store that
configuration in

``/cds/group/pcds/pyps/apps/hutch-python/device_config``

and push it to <https://github.com/pcdshub/device_config/>

Hutch-python configuration paths
--------------------------------

See [Hutch Python
Seminar](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/Hutch+Python+Seminar)
for more details.  You must be added to the relevant instrument group
(ps-<hutch>, e.g. ps-xpp) for write access to these files

For a given hutch, e.g., `xpp`:

| Directory                                          | Description                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /reg/g/pcds/pyps/apps/hutch-python/xpp/            | Base configuration directory, a git repository                                                        |

PLC environment
===============

The plcprog-console node allows for access to production and test network PLCs.
Access to its is documented above in the "remote access" section.

We have our own suite of tools for generating IOCs and checking PLC projects
called "[ads-deploy](https://github.com/pcdshub/ads-deploy)" which wraps
"[pytmc](https://github.com/pcdshub/pytmc)".

You can use ads-deploy easily on plcprog-console by following the [guide
here](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/ads-deploy+on+plcprog-console),
or alternatively on *your own* machine with [this
guide](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=295099767).

Engineering tools
=================

Tools that are of general use to PCDS engineers called
[engineering_tools](https://github.com/pcdshub/engineering_tools) are deployed
and available in: `/reg/g/pcds/engineering_tools/latest/`

shared-dotfiles includes engineering tools in your PATH by default.

GitHub
======
Most of our git repositories are on github. You can browse these at
"[pcdshub](https://github.com/pcdshub)".

Typically these repositories follow a "fork" and "pull request" model for
development. You can read about this in our
"[local](https://pcdshub.github.io/development.html)" documentation and on
"[github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)" itself.

The shared dotfiles contains some helper scripts for keeping your github forks
in sync with the pcdshub upstream:

- git_setup_fork: clones your fork and adds a reference to upstream
- git_sync_upstream: pulls from upstream, pushes to your fork

To make sure this works to your preferences, you should update the "GITHUB_"
variables from the starter .bashrc. Here are the defaults and what they do:

| Variable        | Default   | Description                                            |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| GITHUB_USERNAME | "${USER}" | Your login name for github, used to locate your forks. |
| GITHUB_UPSTREAM | upstream  | The remote name to use for the main/canonical remote.  |
| GITHUB_ORIGIN   | origin    | The remote name to use for your fork.                  |
| GITHUB_MASTER   | master    | The branch name of the organization's main branch.     |

The most common variable to edit is "GITHUB_USERNAME", which often differs from your
SLAC unix username. "GITHUB_UPSTREAM" and "GITHUB_ORIGIN" are user preference- some people
prefer "origin" to point to their fork, while others prefer "origin" to point to the
original repository. "GITHUB_MASTER" should be "master" until we decide to rename all
of our "master" branches to "main" as per latest practices.


Git
===

While not an environment per se, we have git repositories stored on AFS. They
are located here: `/afs/slac/g/cd/swe/git/repos/`

Shared IOCs, for example, are located here:
`/afs/slac/g/cd/swe/git/repos/package/epics/ioc/common/`

EPICS environments
==================

To use the latest EPICS environment, source the following:

Additional shortcuts are automatically included with the above when using the
bash shell. You can see those shortcuts in:

This includes commonly used shortcuts like the LUCID ones (`kfe`, `lfe`, `rix`,
etc.) and others listed in [PCDS EPICS Shortcuts
(pcds_shortcuts.sh)](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=295099127)

Old (maybe outdated) software environments
==========================================

pkg_mgr / pspkg
---------------

`/reg/g/pcds/pkg_mgr` defines a set of isolated environments. Some may still be
in use, but largely we are working with our conda environments (listed above)
now.

See [Package
Manager](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDSArchive/Package+Manager)
(archived) for more details.

Releases are defined in `/reg/g/pcds/pkg_mgr/source/releases`

Per-package information is defined `/reg/g/pcds/pkg_mgr/source/pkg_info`

Released packages and environments are here `/reg/g/pcds/pkg_mgr/release`

controls-basic
--------------

There are some special pkg_mgr environments that remain in use for booting IOCs:

`/reg/g/pcds/pkg_mgr/release/controls-basic-0.0.1`

(See [Detailed Soft IOC boot
process](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/Detailed+Soft+IOC+boot+process)
for ~~too much~~ more information)

Per-hutch configuration directories
===================================

Per-hutch IOC configuration and tooling can be found here:
`/cds/group/pcds/pyps/config/`

Each hutch has its own configured set of tools, such as those for XCS as of January 2022:

| Directory                                     | Description                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| /cds/group/pcds/pyps/config/xcs/camrecord.sh  | Controls recorder                                              |
| /cds/group/pcds/pyps/config/xcs/camviewer.sh  | Camera viewer tool                                             |
| /cds/group/pcds/pyps/config/xcs/expstate.sh   | Experiment state tracking tool (for XCS)                       |
| /cds/group/pcds/pyps/config/xcs/iocmanager.sh | IOC manager (for XCS) to start/stop/add new IOCs (staff guide) |
| /cds/group/pcds/pyps/config/xcs/pmgr.sh       | Parameter manager (for XCS)                                    |
| /cds/group/pcds/pyps/config/xcs/trigtool.sh   | EVR Trigger Tool                                               |


Per-user important directories
==============================

``/cds/group/pcds/epics-dev/${USER}`` is the top-level directory for iocs for
${USER}. You may need to create your own directory here.

IOC data directories and important files
========================================

#### How do these files get generated?

The above files and directories are created through a rather complicated
process.

If you *really* need to get into the weeds of it - for issue debugging or just
a general interest - the following document may be of use to you: [Detailed
Soft IOC boot
process](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/Detailed+Soft+IOC+boot+process)

Otherwise, just ask an expert!

Web-facing applications

| /cds/group/psdm/web/ws/prod/apps              | The experimental logbook, questionnaire, and related web apps source |

Websites
========

Accessing websites from hutches without direct internet access
--------------------------------------------------------------

To use command-line tooling such as curl or wget, set the following environment
variables. Not all hosts will need this - pslogin, psbuild-rhel7 and similar
have direct access.

```bash
export http_proxy=http://psproxy:3128
export https_proxy=http://psproxy:3128
```

Alternatively, ensure that your firefox settings use the above proxy settings
in preferences.
